Day 3 & 4:
==========

Why worry about data structures?
	You cant store everything in files. files are in secondary storage.
	Neither you can store data in some remote server.
	As it will lead to increased delay due to network latency.
	You need data in RAM in your machine to perform processing on it.
	
Why aren't arrays enough?
	Arrays are of fixed size since they are allocated at complie time.
	We need a data structure that can be allocated at run time.
	Also we need a DS that can stored in non-continguous memory locations
